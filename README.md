I have tried to include as much text as possible to narrate my way of thinking and decision making.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this came at the cost of investing more time into code optimization, so please excuse the clutter code and inefficient implementations for the time being. Naturally, in hindsight, I would have coded many things differently.
